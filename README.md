# CalculatorGUI
Basic Calculator made using python3 tkinter module. You can use the .exe file from **dist/Calculator/Calculator.exe**.

**Note:**
Make sure that you clone the entire repository and access the 'Calculator.exe' from the path 'dist/Calculator/Calculator.exe'. This is because the exe has some dependencies to be met.
